# Project 1: WGCNA

Analysis of pig miRNA to find co-expressed genes and aggregate them in modules, which can later be correlated with phenotype traits. The input data are normalized reads count which 
were obtained from RNA-Seq. In the project the similarity trees were generated for samples and genes, heatmap showing correlation between modules and traits, and a heatmaps showing 
expression of genes in modules significantly correlated with traits.

# Project 2: PopEquilibrium

Implementation of population equilibrium according to Hardy-Weinberg law for genetic population lecture. The project uses the randomness to simulate the genotype of one locus for a 
specimen in the population of a given size. Later, the generated population were tested for the equilibrium using Chi-squared test. Finally, the influence of migration and selection
on the population were tested.

# Project 3: testGenPop

Data to question for genetic population test were randomly generated for every student. The data includes the frequencies of genes, genotypes, phenotypes and quantities of 
specimen. Generated data were saved to the .csv file. Finally, for every question in every set of data there were generated the answers and saved to the csv file.
